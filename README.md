# Hash-Table
This program inputs courses into a hash table using separate  chaining for collision resolution. User can print, remove, and find courses.  User can ask for all courses on a day of the week. Hash function splits  course number into 2, two digit sections, sums, divides by table size, and returns the remainder as the index.
